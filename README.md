# dotfiles

My personal Mac setup, managed with nix-darwin and home-manager.
One repo, one command, and a fresh Mac ends up configured the same way every time.

## Contributing / Using This Repo

These are my personal dotfiles, shared publicly so people can read them, learn from them, and fork them freely.
Feature requests and pull requests are not accepted here, and PRs are auto-closed.
If you find a bug, please open a GitHub Issue using the bug report template.

## What you get

Running the switch builds:

- System settings (dark mode, key repeat, dock, Finder, trackpad)
- Homebrew apps (casks and CLI tools)
- Nix user packages (ripgrep, fd, fzf, jq, lazygit, Neovim, Hack Nerd Font)
- Shell (zsh, aliases, starship prompt)
- Editor (Neovim follows macOS appearance: GitHub Dark Default and GitHub Light Default)
- Terminal (WezTerm follows system appearance: Catppuccin Mocha dark, Latte light)
- Agent configs (Claude, Codex, opencode all share one AGENTS.md)

## Prerequisites

- Apple Silicon Mac, by default.
- Intel Mac: change one line.
  In `configuration.nix`, set `nixpkgs.hostPlatform = "x86_64-darwin";` (the comment right there tells you the same thing).

## Fresh-machine setup

On a brand new Mac, from a bare clone of this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dimajarkov/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Before you run it: review "Make it yours" below.
Change the host label or CPU architecture if needed, and read the Homebrew cleanup warning.
`bootstrap.sh` applies the config to your machine, so do this first.

```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

`bootstrap.sh` does four things, in order:

1. Installs Determinate Nix, if it isn't already installed.
2. Symlinks this repo to `~/.dotfiles`.
   This has to happen before the first build, because `home.nix` points at config files through `~/.dotfiles`.
3. Checks the `user` configured in `flake.nix` against your actual macOS username, and offers to fix it for you if they differ.
4. Runs the first `darwin-rebuild switch`.
   It fetches the `darwin-rebuild` tool from the nix-darwin 26.05 release branch, then applies this repo's locked flake config.

After that, `darwin-rebuild` exists and you're on the normal workflow below.

### Validate without applying

Once Nix is installed (`bootstrap.sh` step 1 handles that), you can check that the config builds without touching your system - handy when you have edited something:

```sh
nix flake check --no-build
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.mac.system --dry-run
```

If you renamed the host label in "Make it yours", substitute your label for `mac` in these commands.

## Daily use

Edit the config files in place, then apply:

```sh
./rebuild.sh
```

That's it.
No separate build-and-copy step.

## Make it yours

This repo is mine.
If you clone it, review these before you run `bootstrap.sh`:

- **Username**: run `./bootstrap.sh` (it detects your macOS username and offers to set it) OR change the single `user = "dmitrijarkov"` line in `flake.nix`.
  Everything else (`configuration.nix`, `home.nix`, home directory paths) is threaded from that one variable.
- **Host label** `"mac"`, in three places: `flake.nix` (the `darwinConfigurations."mac"` name), `rebuild.sh:5` (the `#mac` at the end of the flake reference), and `bootstrap.sh`'s first-switch command (also `#mac`).
  All three have to match.
- **CPU architecture**, `hostPlatform` in `configuration.nix` (see Prerequisites above).

**Git identity:** `home.nix` sets my git name and email declaratively.
Before applying this config, replace both values with your own identity or remove them and configure Git separately.

```nix
programs.git = {
  enable = true;
  settings = {
    user.name = "Your Name";
    user.email = "you@example.com";
  };
};
```

**Homebrew cleanup warning:** `configuration.nix` sets `homebrew.onActivation.cleanup = "zap"`.
That means every time you switch, Homebrew removes any package or cask on your machine that isn't listed in the `brews` and `casks` arrays in `configuration.nix`.
If you already have Homebrew stuff installed that isn't in that list, the first switch will uninstall it.
Read through `brews` and `casks` before you run `bootstrap.sh` or `rebuild.sh` for the first time, and add anything you want to keep.

**About `herdr`:** it's in the `brews` list.
It's a real public Homebrew formula (`brew info herdr` finds it in homebrew-core, no tap needed), so it will install fine.
If you don't use it, just remove it from `brews` in your copy.

**Heads-up:**

- `home/AGENTS.md` is my personal agent policy, and `home.nix` installs it for Claude, Codex, and opencode.
  If you clone this repo, you'd silently inherit my agent instructions - edit or delete `home/AGENTS.md` if you don't want that.
- The `cc` and `co` shell aliases in `home.nix` are high-agency shortcuts: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` and `codex --full-auto`.
  They're convenient for me, but know what they do before you use them.

## Repo tour

- `flake.nix` - the entry point.
  Wires up nixpkgs, nix-darwin, home-manager, and nix-homebrew, and declares the `mac` machine.
- `configuration.nix` - system-level config: macOS defaults, Homebrew.
- `home.nix` - user-level config: shell, packages, prompt, and the symlinks described below.
- `rebuild.sh` - re-applies the config after the first switch.
  Run this every time you make a change.
- `home/` - the actual config files that get symlinked into place (Hammerspoon, Neovim, WezTerm, herdr, Claude settings, the shared `AGENTS.md`).

## How the symlinks work

The files under `home/` are the real files - editing them here is editing your live config, no rebuild needed to see the change in your editor.
`home.nix` uses `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` to point paths like `~/.config/nvim` straight at `home/.config/nvim` in this repo, so the two never drift out of sync.
You only run `./rebuild.sh` when you change something that isn't just a symlinked file, like a package list or a system default.

## Notes

The first time you launch `nvim`, Neovim's built-in `vim.pack` clones the configured plugins from GitHub.
That needs network access once; after that it's offline.
Neovim uses GitHub Dark Default in macOS dark mode and GitHub Light Default in light mode, with opaque backgrounds for readable contrast.
It reads the macOS appearance at startup, on focus, and every two seconds while open, without blocking editing or requiring a terminal theme notification.
A manual colorscheme selection (`<leader>fc`) lasts until the system appearance changes.
On non-macOS hosts, Neovim selects the palette using its `background` option, including terminal-driven changes.
WezTerm independently follows system appearance with Catppuccin Mocha and Latte.

Read a saved Markdown buffer with `:Glow` or `<leader>mp` (Space, M, P).
The preview runs Glow's interactive reader in a real terminal, using Glow's configured colors and width; press `q` to return to the document and its original cursor position.
Restart Neovim after changing its configuration; no rebuild is needed for these symlinked files.
Glow 2.1.2 carries a local content-caching backport in `nix/patches/glow-resize.patch` to prevent blank previews when shrinking the terminal.
Run `./rebuild.sh` to activate Glow package changes, then close any existing preview and reopen it with `:Glow`.

After launching Neovim once to install the plugins, run the Neovim regression tests from the repo root:

```sh
nvim --headless -u NONE -l tests/nvim-appearance.lua
python3 tests/nvim-appearance-tui.py # macOS: full TUI against the real system appearance
python3 tests/nvim-glow-tui.py # real visible content/colors after width/height resizes, and returning to the source buffer
```

The Lua tests exercise both palettes, live changes, failure recovery, reload safety, and non-macOS behavior without changing the system appearance.
